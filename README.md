# Quantum-Well-Simulation-
C++ software that simulates quantum well optical absorption and phase modulation under different electric fields.
Built using visual studio 2010
Features:
1. Use multi-threads to  to parallelly computes optical absorption and phase modulation for different electric field values. Threads number can be set in input file.
2. Use Transfer Matrix Methord to compute wavefunction for electrons and light holes. 
3. Use Tridiagonal Matrix Algorithm to compute wavefunction for heavy holes.
